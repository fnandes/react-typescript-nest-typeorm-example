# A complete web project with React + Redux + Hooks + TypeScript + NestJS + TypeORM + Jest

This project claims to be a complete project example with the most modern technologies and frameworks available today. The source code is beginner friendly, which means that all code is easy to understand and well commented.

## Work in progress

- [x] NestJS
- [ ] TypeORM
- [x] TypeScript
- [ ] Jest on Backend
- [ ] Jest + Enzyme on Frontend
- [ ] React
- [ ] Redux
- [ ] ReduxForm
- [ ] styled-components
- [ ] Setup develop, production environment
- [ ] 12-factor

## Motivation

There is thousands of different projects in the GitHub containing examples of projects in React, Express, etc. Every single project has been made with a different architecture, some ones uses TypeScript, some others don't, the same happens for each other library and choice made in this project.
I missed a more concrete example, with everything that a modern web application must have, like tests, 12-factor implementation, a good web framework, a good ORM.
